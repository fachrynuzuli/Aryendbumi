#### without conflict there's no change
*02 Sep, 2024* 

The level of conflict you're willing to endure will be the level of change you inflict. Inadvertently when we introduce change, not everyone is going to be thrilled. We never really thought about the relationship between conflict and change from this perspective.

In times of turmoil, embracing change is not an option but a necessity for growth. Despite everyone understanding the statement, not everyone is going to be as pumped when you introduce new practices. Consensus often fails, but for greater good— *if you please everyone, you please no one*.

We often met with this brilliant individual, every once in a while they popped up —not to push an established agenda, but to bring diversity, sparks an argument, and inviting disagreement. They rather invoke thought provoking perspective to avoid flat agreement, knowing full well that's how we're going to grow and improve. They drive collective changes through different opinion as every disagreement is an opportunity to improve ourselves.

That's the spirit of any self-improvers on any public domain imaginable. Online writing, content creation, journalism, politics, even standup comedian. If neither of us showing up due to the risk of backlash and different viewpoints, no one would have had opportunity to engage in a conflict that eventually changes perspective.

As a leader, you want to have a healthy level of conflict in your organization. You want people to disagree, challenge ideas and bring new ideas. Harmony is great, but the long term impact of high agreeableness will withstand any potentially good idea rises to the top.

Best performer often the most annoying ones. They ask most, they challenges constantly. But that's exactly how we create launchpad to greater outcomes. Outcomes that would not be possible with an all round YES people.
