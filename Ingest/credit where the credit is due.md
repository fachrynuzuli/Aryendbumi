#### want to get ahead? give credit where it's due!
*06 Sep, 2024* 

For every successful event I've ever experienced in my careerhood, one quote has been the lifeblood of my career: **"Credit where the credit is due."**

Recognizing other's efforts can incrementally increases our chance of success. 
Here's how it works:

**Recognizing others build trust among team members.** When you acknowledge other's hard work publicly, it's a sign that you know and value their contributions. Like in a team meeting, highlighting your peer's significant role in a project will almost always build mutual respect. This, will promote a culture of openness.

**Recognition encourages colaboration.** Collaboration thrives in an environment of mutual respect. By recognizing them regularly, you create an atmosphere where others feel comfortable sharing ideas working together. I claim to 10x'ed overall team performance just by perform this correctly, carefully, and intentionally.

**Giving credit help builds positive work environment.** When you make it a habit to give credit, you contribute to a supportive and motivating workplace. A simple act of appreciation towards colleague for their work can make a significant difference. This approach not only boosts team morale but also increase the sense of belonging and purpose beneath the group.

Work is a place where you learn how to teach others without teaching. Tell others without telling, and ask others without asking.

The true test is pretending that you're actually managing your peers—sideways, working collaboratively for collective mutual purpose, without even assigned directly as their supervisor.

With this mindset, I guarantee you'll always give credit where the credit is due.
