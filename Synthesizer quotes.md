# Synthesizer a.k.a Polymath

___

>“We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, think critically about it, and make important choices wisely.” — E. O. Wilson, biologist, theorist, naturalist and author

>“The problems of modern man are interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, that is to say, a proper solution of these problems requires information and methods which stem from many disciplines.” —Henry Winthrop

>"The wisdom needed must be the creative synthesis of the best in past human effort, in contemporary proposals, and in the modes of action that are foreseen as humanity’s choices for its own future.” —Henry Winthrop (quoting Oliver Reiser)

> "Shifts in technology and human behavior are creating the need for “synthesizers” – people who can filter through the ambient noise being generated in fast-moving business environments and distill thinking into clear and actionable insights, ideas and strategies – which ultimately informs creative and innovative problem solving.” -David Armano, visual thinking expert

>“One form of originality is creation. Another form is synthesis. People often focus so much on creating new ideas that they overlook the value of synthesizing ideas from different sources. Innovation usually mean connecting previously unconnected concepts.” — [[James Clear]], author of [[Atomic Habits]]

> _“Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses — especially learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.”_ —Leonardo Da Vinci

>“In the future, the great division will be between those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and can never focus enough to learn.” —Robert Greene

> "A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects." — Robert A. Heinlein, Time Enough for Love
