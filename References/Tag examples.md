>[!tip] Using tags
>Tags are great to make your notes more searchable. However, they can easily become another distracting organizational task to maintain them all as your vault grows. So I recommend using them scarcely. 

>[!info] Nesting tags
>You can nest tags the same way you nest folders. 
>For example: ``#source/book``
