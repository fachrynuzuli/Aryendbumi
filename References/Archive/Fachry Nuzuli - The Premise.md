I need you to tell a story about an optimistic generalist that's going through a hard time living named Fachry. He's going through quite a hero's journey, but not against any villain, it's against himself. Fachry was a Zillenial, meaning he's born between 1992 - 2002, at the intersection of Gen X or Millenial, and Gen Z.

Zillenials borrowed their mindset from Millenials, but living through a painful internet age against Gen Z. Zillenials don't have enough skillset to navigate the internet. Internet was just a tool that doesn't even working, let alone be the mainly driver of work. They're the beta-tester of the internet age. "How can someone possibly earn a living through internet? it's a scam!."

Zillenials, by default, loves corporate job. They work their ass off for this. They go to school, get good grades, go to college, graduate, get a job, marry, buy a house, having children, and the cycle repeats. Why would they throw it all away for a shaky internet money that doesn't need an MBA for the requirement to earn Rp100 Million a month (Indonesian Rupiah)? "It's a fucking scam!," they would say.

One thing that they (Zillenials) don't realize, they're playing the Millenial's game where the Millenials already at the right spot in the corporate world. They don't climb the ladder, they are the ladder! On the opposite side, Gen Z don't even play in the same playing field, instead of aiming for managing a unit, they prefer to have lean online business leveraging social media by dances and trends, a world where Zillenials also can't figure out by themself.

Fachry, sees this as a problem. He aims to bring 10 thousands, or even 10 millions of people from the same generation to fight back in the even arena of internet. Fachry will drive the massive mindset shift, learn new applicable skills, and coordinating the movement. People will learn new skills, believe in themself, and applying or swarming an existing jobs taken by Gen Z, driving production cost down. Zillenials need to sail this world entirely different than what they're going to do before they realize their problem.

So, Fachry demanded them to change the world, starting from their mindset. Start from Indonesia, hopefully will scale to the worlds
