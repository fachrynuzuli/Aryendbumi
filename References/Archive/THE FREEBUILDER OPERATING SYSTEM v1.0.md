### **TIER 1: HIGH-TICKET \- Rapid MVP Sprint (DFY Service)**

**Price:** $497 (Days 1-14) → $997 (Days 15-30)  
**Launch:** Day 7 (Soft announce) → Day 10 (Hard launch)  
**Platform:** Whop (Custom booking app) \+ Cal.com  
**Delivery:** 48-hour turnaround

**What's Included:**

* Full app build using free AI tools  
* Deployed to Vercel (live URL)  
* Source code ownership (GitHub repo)  
* 1 round of revisions  
* 30-min walkthrough call

**Positioning:**  
"I'll build your MVP in 48 hours using the same free AI tools from my challenge. No monthly fees. You own everything. Perfect for founders who need to test ideas fast."

**Business Playbook Check:**

* ✅ Pain (3P): "I have an idea but can't code / hiring devs is $10K+ / been stuck for 6 months"  
* ✅ Measurable Result: "Working MVP deployed to live URL in 48 hours"  
* ✅ Timeframe: "48 hours from deposit"  
* ✅ Delivery Method: "Done-for-you, minimal client input needed"  
* ✅ Risk Reversal: "If I don't deliver in 48 hours, full refund \+ $100 for wasting your time"  
* ✅ Price Anchoring: "$497 vs $10K developer \= 95% savings"

**Emotional Copy (How Long Have You Been Stuck?):**

| `You've had this idea for 6 months. A year?You've researched developers. $10K minimum. 3-month timeline.You've looked at no-code tools. Still too technical.Meanwhile, your competitor just launched.What if you could test your idea THIS WEEK for $497?` |
| :---- |

**Launch Trigger:**

* Day 7: Pin comment on viral video: "Building your idea next. 5 spots. $497. DM 'BUILD'"  
* Day 10: Official Whop listing \+ Cal.com booking  
* Goal: 3 clients by Day 15 \= $1,491-$2,991

**Objection Handling:**

| `"Too expensive" → "Developers charge $10K and take 3 months. I deliver in a week for $497." "Will it actually work?" → "Watch my 30-day series. Every app works. Yours will too." "What if I need changes?" → "1 round of revisions included. After that, $97/change or join BuilderHaus."` |
| :---- |

**"$497 is too expensive"**  
→ "I get it. $497 feels like a lot. But here's the math: Developers charge $10K minimum and take 3 months. I deliver in 48 hours for $497. That's 95% cheaper and 180x faster. Plus, if I don't deliver in 48 hours, you get refunded \+ $100. The real question: How much is 3 more months of NOT knowing if your idea works costing you?"

**"Will it actually work?"**  
→ "Watch my 30-day series. Every app works. Day X I built \[specific app\] in 45 minutes. Here's the deployed link: \[show actual app\]. I'm not a student. I'm a PM who ships daily. Your app will work. And if it doesn't, full refund \+ $100."

**"I need to think about it"**  
→ "Smart. What specifically do you need to think about?" \[They'll reveal real objection: price, trust, timing\] \[Address specific concern\] "Here's what I suggest: Watch Days 15-20 of my series where I build B2B apps. If you like what you see, book a call. Fair?"

**"Let me talk to my co-founder"**  
→ "Definitely. Here's what might help: I can do a quick 15-min call with both of you to scope the idea. No charge. Then you both decide together. Or, if you want to show them something first, here's my portfolio: \[link to best 5 builds from series\]. Sounds good?"

### **TIER 2: LOW-TICKET \- Advanced Freebuilder Runbook (DIY Digital Product)**

**Price:** $49 one-time  
**Launch:** Day 15 (After first service clients land)  
**Platform:** Whop (Digital Product)

**What's Included:**

* 30+ deep-dive video breakdowns (30-60 min each)  
* PRD templates & product frameworks  
* Complete portfolio builder system  
* Tool mastery guides (Claude Code, Antigravity, Vercel, Supabase, Code Rabbit)  
* GitHub source code links  
* Lifetime updates  
* **MONETIZATION MODULE:**  
  * How to start AI MVP Agency  
  * How to get first clients with minimal outreach — includes client proposal templates  
  * Launch your MVP Agency websites and social profiles  
  * How to close client calls — How to charge $500-$2K per builds — includes pricing calculator  
  * PRDs (Product Requirement Document) are non-negotiable — scope management strategies  
  * Protect yourself before closing — contract and invoice templates

**Positioning:**  
"You watched me build for free. Now learn how to charge $500-$2K for the same builds. This playbook shows you how to turn free tools into paid work."

**Business Playbook Check:**

* ✅ Pain: "I can build but don't know how to monetize/been giving work away for free"  
* ✅ Measurable Result: "Land 1 paid client ($500+) or 3 job interviews in 30 days"  
* ✅ Timeframe: "30 days from purchase"  
* ✅ Delivery Method: "Self-serve digital product with templates \+ videos"  
* ✅ Risk Reversal: "If you implement and get zero results in 30 days, full refund"  
* ✅ Price: $49 \= Impulse buy territory (less than 1 hour of client work)

**Emotional Copy (How Long Have You Been Stuck?):**

| `You've been giving away your work for free. Your friends say "can you build me something?" You say yes because you want the practice. But practice doesn't pay rent. What if the next time someone asks, you could say: "My rate is $800. Here's my portfolio."` |
| :---- |

**Launch Strategy:**

* Use first 3 service clients as case studies  
* "I just made $1,500 building apps for clients. Here's how you can too."  
* Social proof: "Sarah used these templates to land her first $800 client in 2 weeks"

**Objection Handling:**

**"Why should I pay $49 when the Runbook is free?"**  
**→** "Great question. The free Runbook shows you WHAT I built and basic prompts. The $49 Playbook shows you HOW to charge clients $500-$2K for the same builds. Think of it this way: Free Runbook \= fishing rod. Paid Playbook \= fishing business. You're not paying for information. You're paying for the monetization system. And if you implement it for 30 days and don't land a single paid opportunity, full refund."

**"I'm not technical enough"**  
**→** "Neither was Alex. Alex was a customer support manager. Zero coding background. He bought the Playbook on Day 12 of my challenge. Used the PRD templates to map 3 projects. Built them using my exact prompts (copy-paste). 30 days later: Applied to 15 PM roles. Got 6 interviews. Landed $105K APM role. His words: 'I didn't learn to code. I learned to ship. That's what companies want.' If Alex can do it, you can too."

**Revenue Target:** 100 sales \= $4,900

### **TIER 3: RECURRING \- BuilderHaus Community (DWY Support)**

* Direct async access to you (Whop chat)

* Referral bonuses

**Positioning:**  
"You've proven you can build. Now turn it into consistent income. BuilderHaus is where serious builders land jobs, get clients, and ship for money—not just practice."

**Business Playbook Check:**

* ✅ Pain: "I can build but struggle with consistency / accountability / monetization"  
* ✅ Measurable Result (90-Day Paths): "Land 2 paid clients OR 5 job interviews OR launch 1 profitable project in 90 days"  
  * Path A: Land 2 paid clients ($1K-$5K total)  
  * Path B: Get 5 job interviews in 60 days  
  * Path C: Launch profitable side project ($500+) in 90 days

* ✅ Timeframe: "90 days of active engagement"  
* ✅ Delivery Method: "Private community \+ live sessions \+ job leads \+ reviews"  
* ✅ Risk Reversal: "Engage fully for 90 days (attend sessions, post builds, ask for help). If you hit ZERO of your chosen path's milestones, we refund your last 3 months."  
* ✅ Price: $49/mo \= Netflix price point, but changes your income

**Emotional Copy (How Long Have You Been Stuck?):**

| `Real Talk: How Long Have You Been "Going To" Do This? You've been talking about: • Starting that side project (for how long?) • Landing a PM job (how many applications?) • Charging for your work (but you give it away free) You don't need more tutorials. You don't need another course. You need accountability. You need a community that ships. You need people who'll call you out when you're stalling. BuilderHaus is that. We're not nice. We're effective. If you're serious about turning building into income, join. If you're still "thinking about it," stay in the free Runbook. Your move.` |
| :---- |

**Objection Handling:**

**"I can't afford $49/month right now"**

→ "I totally get it. Here's what I suggest: Start with the free Runbook. Build one project. If you get traction, grab the $49 Playbook (one-time). Use it to land your first paid client ($500+). THEN join BuilderHaus with your client money. The community will help you get clients 2-5, and suddenly $49/mo is easy. Sound like a plan?"

**"Will I actually get results?"**

→ "Depends on you. I can't promise results if you don't engage. But here's what I CAN promise: If you (1) Attend the weekly sessions, (2) Post your builds for feedback, (3) Ship at least 1 project per month, (4) Ask for help in the channels... and you hit ZERO of your 90-day milestones, I'll refund your last 3 months. So the real question: Are you willing to show up?"

2. **Garry Tan** (@garrytan) \- Y Combinator president  
3. **Guillermo Rauch** (@rauchg) \- Vercel CEO (technical)  
4. **Jason Calacanis** (@jason) \- Loud, engagement-focused

**The 3-Hour Strike Window:**

**Step 1: Social Listening (Set up NOW)**

* Use TweetDeck columns for each target  
* Search phrases: "wish there was", "hate doing", "why is X so hard"  
* Get notifications on mobile

**Step 2: The Strike (When VC complains)**

* You have 3 hours to build solution  
* Use Bolt.new (fastest deployment)  
* Buy clever domain ($2 on Namecheap): e.g., "fixgarrysbilling.com"

**Step 3: The Deployment**

* Deploy to Vercel (shows you're technical)  
* Make it actually work (not just a landing page)  
* Add "Built in 2 hours with free AI tools" in footer

**Step 4: The Reply**  
**Script:**  
"@TargetVC saw you hated \[problem\]. Annoyed me too. Built this in 2 hours using free AI: \[link\]

Video of the build 👇 \[attach 30s speed-run video\]"

**Psychology:**

* You solved THEIR problem (not selling yours)  
* "2 hours" \= impressive speed  
* Video \= proof you actually built it  
* "free AI" \= relatability

**Success Metric:** 1 VC engagement \= 100K+ impressions

## **Crisis Management Protocols**

### **Crisis 1: Views Tank (\<500 views by Day 5\)**

**Diagnosis:** Hook isn't working or timing is off

**Action Plan:**

1. Test 3 new hooks (change first 3 seconds)  
2. Instead of "I built X", try "Don't pay for X"  
3. Shorten video to 45 seconds (attention span)  
4. Post 2x daily if possible (weekends only)  
5. Check audio: Is music too loud? Is ASMR present?

**Emergency Hook Templates:**

* "This app wants $30/month. I built it in 30 minutes."  
* "Day X: Still unemployed. Built \[thing\] today."  
* "Stop paying for \[tool\]. Here's the free version."

### **Crisis 2: Code Breaks / AI Fails**

**Response: POST THE FAILURE**

**Title:** "Day 12: This might be the day I quit"

**Content:**

* Show the AI hallucinating  
* Show the broken app  
* Show your frustration (authentic)  
* End: "Tomorrow I'm trying a different approach"

**Why This Works:**

* Vulnerability \= trust  
* Humanizes the journey  
* "Comeback video" next day gets 2x views  
* People root for underdogs

**Follow-up (Next Day):**

* "Day 13: I fixed it. Here's what I learned"  
* Show the working version  
* Explain the fix simply  
* Position as learning moment

### **Crisis 3: No Service Clients by Day 15**

**Response: THE "FREE WORK" OFFER**

**Action:**

* Pin comment: "I need portfolio pieces. Building the next 3 ideas for FREE. DM me your idea."  
* Requirements: Must be willing to testimonial  
* Must be okay with you filming the process  
* Deliver in 48 hours

**Why This Works:**

* You need social proof \> you need $500  
* 3 free projects \= 3 case studies  
* Case studies sell the $49 Playbook  
* You can upsell to BuilderHaus later

**What You Get:**

* Testimonials with numbers  
* Real-world portfolio pieces  
* Content for Days 16-18 (building client work)  
* Proof for Playbook launch

### **Crisis 4: Burnout / Can't Keep Pace**

**Response: SIMPLIFY & SURVIVE**

**Action:**

1. Switch to 30-min builds only (utility tools)  
2. Use v0 exclusively (fastest)  
3. Pre-record during weekends (batch 3-4)  
4. Shorten videos to 45s (less editing)  
5. Remember: DONE \> PERFECT

**Builds That Take \<30 Min:**

* QR code generator  
* Color palette from image  
* Lorem ipsum generator  
* Password strength checker  
* Unit converter  
* Tip calculator  
* Countdown timer

**The Mantra:** "The series only works if I finish all 30 days."

# **PART III: DAILY OPERATIONS MANUAL**

## **The Morning Routine (Every Day \- Before Work)**

**6:00 AM \- 6:10 AM: Metrics Check (While Coffee Brewing)**

* Check yesterday's video: Views, comments, shares  
* Check DMs: Any "BUILD" inquiries? (service leads \= priority)  
* Check email: Runbook sign-ups, sales notifications  
* Log in spreadsheet (track everything)

**Metrics Spreadsheet Template:**

| Day | Date | Views | Comments | Bio Clicks | Sign-ups | DMs | Sales | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Jan 1 | 1.2K | 87 | 150 | 45 | 3 | 0 | Launch day |
| 2 | Jan 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**6:10 AM \- 6:15 AM: Today's Build Selection**

* Check 30-day arc (what week am I in?)  
* Pick build from recommended list  
* Complexity check: Do I have time today?  
* If weekday \+ complex build → swap for simpler one

**Simple Builds for Weekdays (\<30 min):**

* QR code generator  
* Color palette extractor  
* Password strength checker  
* Unit converter  
* Tip calculator  
* Lorem ipsum generator  
* Countdown timer  
* Favicon generator

**6:15 AM \- 6:20 AM: Mental Prep**

* Read one objection handling script (memorization)  
* Review yesterday's best comment (motivation)  
* Set intention: "Today I ship Day X/30. No excuses."

**Then: Go to work (6:30 AM \- 6:00 PM)**

---

## **The Evening Execution (6:00 PM \- 11:00 PM)**

### **Phase 1: Build (6:00 PM \- 7:30 PM)**

**6:00 PM \- 6:15 PM: Setup**

* Open tool (Lovable, Bolt.new, or Cursor)  
* Have phone ready for screen recording  
* **START OBS/SCREEN RECORDING NOW** (capture everything, even failures)  
* Put phone in Do Not Disturb (focus mode)

**6:15 PM \- 7:15 PM: Build**

* Use natural language prompts (stay in character)  
* Don't code manually (you're "vibe-coding", not coding)  
* If stuck \>10 min, try different tool or pivot to simpler feature  
* Target: Working prototype by 7:15 PM

**Pro Tips:**

* If Lovable is slow, use Bolt.new, or v0 (faster but less customizable)  
* If both fail, use Cursor (more control but requires more input)  
* Keep prompts conversational: "Make me a habit tracker that roasts users when they miss a day"

**7:15 PM \- 7:30 PM: Deploy & Test**

* Deploy to Vercel (get live URL)  
* Test on phone (this becomes demo footage)  
* **Record phone demo** (hand holding phone, clicking through app)  
* Take screenshot for thumbnail

**STOP SCREEN RECORDING** (you now have raw footage)

---

### **Phase 2: Film & Edit (7:30 PM \- 8:30 PM)**

**7:30 PM \- 7:45 PM: Film Talking Head Segments**

**Intro (Record this):**  
"Day X/30. Today I'm building \[thing that solves problem\]. Let's go."

**Outro (Record this):**  
"Day X/30 complete. Code and prompts in the free Runbook. Link in bio. Tomorrow: \[tease next build\]. See you then."

**Optional Mid-Build Reactions (if something interesting happened):**

* "Wait, it's actually working..."  
* "Okay this is broken. Let me fix it."  
* "This took 15 minutes. \[Tool\] charges $30/month for this."

**7:45 PM \- 8:30 PM: Edit (CapCut or Premiere Pro)**

**EDITING CHECKLIST (Non-Negotiable):**

**Must-Have Elements:**

* Add "Day X/30: Y Days Left" watermark (top-left, bright red, Impact font)  
* Add "FREE TIER / $0" stamp when opening any tool (with thud sound)  
* SNAP ZOOM (200%) to prompt text (make it readable on mobile)  
* Speed ramp boring parts to 1000% (cut all loading bars)  
* Add split screen: prompt left, result right (around 0:30-0:50)  
* Boost keyboard ASMR sounds (+5dB)  
* Add phone mockup for final demo (use Shots.so)  
* Truncate ALL silence (no gaps \>0.1s)  
* Add background music (Lo-fi or Phonk, volume at \-20dB, voice at \-3dB)  
* Total video length: 60-90 seconds

**Structure Check:**

* 0:00-0:03: Hook with final result  
* 0:03-0:15: Setup (show prompt)  
* 0:15-0:30: Speed-run build  
* 0:30-0:50: Iteration/improvement  
* 0:50-1:10: Physical proof (phone demo)  
* 1:10-1:30: CTA \+ tomorrow tease

**8:30 PM: Export** (while video exports, start next phase)

---

### **Phase 3: Prep & Post (8:30 PM \- 10:00 PM)**

**8:30 PM \- 8:45 PM: Write Caption**

**Caption Formula:**

Day X/30: \[One-line hook about the build\]

I refused to pay $\[price\] for \[tool\], so I built it in \[time\] using free AI.

\[One sentence: what it does\]  
\[One sentence: the tech used\]

\#freebuilder \#buildwithAI \#\[niche hashtag\]

**Real Example:**

Day 12/30: Invoice Generator (Because I Hate Spreadsheets)

## **Decision Tree (When Things Go Wrong)**

### **SCENARIO: Still at work, realize build is too complex**

→ **ACTION:** SWAP for 30-min utility build (see weekday list)  
→ Save complex build for weekend  
→ Better to ship simple than miss a day

### **SCENARIO: Tool isn't working (Claude rate limit, Lovable is down)**

→ **ACTION:** SWITCH tools immediately  
→ Have backups ready: Lovable → Bolt.new → v0 → aistudio   
→ Worst case: Build something simpler with working tool

### **SCENARIO: Video editing taking \>1 hour**

→ **ACTION:** SIMPLIFY  
→ Use CapCut template (faster)  
→ Remove optional elements (keep only: watermark, mockup, CTA)  
→ Post even if "not perfect" (done \> perfect)

### **SCENARIO: Missed posting window (life happened)**

→ **ACTION:** POST ANYWAY at 11 PM WIB  
→ Better late than never  
→ Explain in caption: "Day X (late post): Had a work emergency. Still shipping."  
→ Authenticity \> consistency theater

### **SCENARIO: Got job offer mid-challenge**

→ **ACTION:** KEEP BUILDING (integrity)  
→ Negotiate start date for post-Day 30  
→ Use as content: "Day 20: Just got a job offer. Still finishing what I started."  
→ This makes better story

### **SCENARIO: VC/investor reaches out**

→ **ACTION:** STAY COOL (don't thirst)  
→ Reply: "Thanks for reaching out\! Let's chat after Day 30—I want to finish the series first. Here's my calendar: \[link\]"  
→ Continue building (this IS your leverage)

### **SCENARIO: Burned out / can't continue**

→ **ACTION:** SCALE DOWN (don't quit)  
→ 30-min builds only for next 3 days  
→ Use pre-recorded buffer content  
→ Take one day off if absolutely necessary (but COMMUNICATE: "Day X: Taking a mental health day. Back tomorrow.")  
→ Remember: Finishing 30 days \> perfection

### **SCENARIO: Someone copies your content/idea**

→ **ACTION:** IGNORE (don't engage)  
→ You can't stop copycats  
→ Your authenticity is your moat  
→ Keep building

### **SCENARIO: Negative comments ("This is easy" / "AI will replace you")**

→ **ACTION:** DON'T TAKE THE BAIT  
→ Reply once, politely: "Cool\! Show me what you build. I'd love to see it."  
→ Then ignore further engagement  
→ Haters are algorithm engagement

## **Day 30 Launch \- BUILDERHAUS OPEN \+ SERIES FINALE**

### **Morning Email (9:00 AM WIB)**

**Subject:** "Day 30: Here's what happened (BuilderHaus is open)"

**Body:**

Hey \[Name\],

It's Day 30\. The end of "Prompt It Till You Make It."

Here's what happened:

✅ Built 30 production apps (all with free tools)  
✅ Landed 5 paid clients ($3,500 total revenue)  
✅ Helped 10,000+ people start building

What I learned:  
• Free tools can build real products  
• Shipping daily builds consistency  
• Community matters more than tools

What's next: BuilderHaus is open.

The private community for serious builders who want income, not just practice.

→ Weekly sessions with experts  
→ Job board with direct member intros  
→ Client lead sharing (members refer overflow work)  
→ Portfolio reviews (monthly feedback)  
→ $500 monthly build prizes  
→ Advanced playbooks

$49/mo or $490/year (save $98)

Founding members (first 100): $39/mo locked forever

Day 30/30: This Is The End (And The Beginning)

# **PART V: THE NON-NEGOTIABLES**

## **8 Rules That Override Everything**

### **1\. Finish All 30 Days, No Matter What**

* Got job offer Day 10? Keep building.  
* Views tanking Day 18? Keep building.  
* Sick on Day 25? Post a simple build or pre-recorded buffer.  
* Someone copies you? Keep building.  
* No one cares? Keep building.

**Why:** The story only works if you see it through. Quitting at Day 20 makes you a statistic. Finishing at Day 30 makes you a case study.

### **2\. Never Apologize for Free Tools**

* Don't say "it's just free tools"  
* Don't say "I wish I could use paid"  
* Don't say "this would be better with X"

**Frame:** "This constraint makes me more creative."

**You're not limited. You're proving a point.**

### **3\. Post The Failures**

* When code breaks, film it.  
* When AI hallucinates, show it.  
* When you're frustrated, say it.

**Why:** Vulnerability \= trust. Comeback videos get 2x views.

**The pattern:** Day X: "This broke." → Day X+1: "I fixed it."

### **4\. Reply to Every Service Inquiry Within 1 Hour**

* Someone DMs "BUILD" \= money.  
* Drop everything and reply (even at work, use lunch break).  
* Strike while intent is hot (24 hours later, they'll forget).

**Priority:** Service DMs \> Everything else

### **5\. Validate Before Building (Products)**

* Get 5 people to commit money before launching.  
* If you can't pre-sell to 5, your offer needs work.  
* Friends count (but must be real money, not promises).

**The rule:** No validation \= No launch

### **6\. Integrity Always**

* Never fake results (views, revenue, testimonials).  
* Never buy views/followers.  
* Never promise what you can't deliver.  
* If you mess up, admit it publicly.

**Why:** Your reputation is your only real asset. Virality is temporary. Trust is permanent.

### **7\. Sleep Matters**

* No hero hours on workdays (you have a 6 AM job).  
* Burned out creator \= dead series.  
* Simplify builds if needed to protect sleep.  
* 7 hours minimum (non-negotiable).

**Better strategy:** Ship 30 "good enough" apps than 15 perfect ones.

### **8\. Done \> Perfect**

* Ship "good enough" daily.  
* Perfect is the enemy of shipped.  
* A working app with bugs \> no app.  
* You can always improve later.

**The mantra:** "Shipped beats polished. Always."

# **PART VI: SUCCESS METRICS & MILESTONES**

## **Week 1 Targets (Days 1-7)**

### **Metrics to Hit:**

* 500+ Runbook sign-ups  
* Average 1K+ views per video  
* 50+ comments per video  
* 3+ service inquiries  
* 1 pre-committed service client (deposit or handshake)

### **Red Flags (If You're Missing These):**

* Views \<500: Test 3 new hooks (change first 3 seconds)  
* Comments \<30: Ask questions in video ("What should I build next?")  
* Sign-ups \<100: Make CTA clearer ("Free prompts in bio")  
* Zero inquiries: Add service mention in every video

### **Action Plan If Behind:**

* Shorten videos to 45 seconds (attention span)  
* Post in 3 communities (Reddit r/SideProject, Indie Hackers, relevant Discord)  
* DM 10 founders directly about service  
* Use holiday buffer days to catch up

---

## **Week 2 Targets (Days 8-14)**

### **Metrics to Hit:**

* 1,500+ total Runbook sign-ups (cumulative)  
* Average 2K+ views per video  
* 1-2 service clients delivered  
* $500-$1,500 revenue (from service)  
* 50+ "PLAYBOOK" interest responses (validation for Day 15\)

### **Red Flags:**

* No service clients yet: Launch "free work" offer (3 projects for portfolio)  
* Views declining: Double down on Week 2 content arc (Clone Wars \= authority)  
* No monetization interest: You're not positioning value clearly

### **Action Plan If Behind:**

* Service: Offer founding rate ($297 instead of $497)  
* Content: Show client work process (behind-the-scenes)  
* Outreach: DM 20 founders about MVP Sprint

---

## **Week 3 Targets (Days 15-21)**

### **Metrics to Hit:**

* 3,000+ total Runbook sign-ups  
* Playbook launch: 50-100 sales ($1,950-$4,900)  
* 3-5 total service clients delivered ($1,500-$5,000)  
* One video \>10K views (viral threshold)

### **Red Flags:**

* Playbook sales \<20: Add more value (reduce price to $29, add bonuses)  
* No viral video yet: Test more aggressive hooks  
* Service pipeline dry: Focus on B2B builds this week (attracts clients)

### **Action Plan If Behind:**

* Playbook: Create urgency (price increases Day 20\)  
* Service: Package deal (3 MVPs for $1,200 \= $400 savings)  
* Content: Post 2x daily on weekends

---

## **Week 4 Targets (Days 22-30)**

### **Metrics to Hit:**

* 5,000+ total Runbook sign-ups  
* 100+ Playbook sales ($3,900-$4,900)  
* $5K-$10K total revenue (service \+ digital)  
* 150+ BuilderHaus waitlist  
* 1 VC/influencer engagement (QRT, DM, or mention)

### **Red Flags:**

* Revenue \<$5K: Need more aggressive service outreach  
* Waitlist \<50: Community positioning unclear  
* No influencer engagement: VC Sniper Protocol not executed

### **Action Plan If Behind:**

* Revenue: Emergency consulting offer ($999 for 4 calls)  
* Waitlist: Add more founding perks (bonus course, lower price)  
* Influencer: Execute VC Sniper Protocol NOW (build solutions to their complaints)

---

## **End Goal (Day 30\)**

### **Minimum Success Criteria:**

* 100 BuilderHaus members ($3,900-$4,900/mo recurring)  
* $10K+ Month 1 revenue (service \+ digital \+ community)  
* Clear next steps (full-time builder OR leverage for better job)  
* Portfolio of 30 working apps

### **Stretch Goals:**

* 200 BuilderHaus members ($7,800-$9,800/mo)  
* $20K+ Month 1 revenue  
* VC/investor meeting scheduled  
* Media feature (ProductHunt, Hacker News, tech blog)

# **PART VII: POST-DAY 30 SCENARIOS**

## **Scenario A: Hit Revenue Goals ($10K+)**

**What This Means:**

* You've proven the business model  
* You have recurring revenue ($5K+ MRR from BuilderHaus)  
* You have multiple income streams (service \+ digital \+ community)

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Give notice at job** (if you haven't already and feel comfortable)  
2. **Negotiate:** If you like the job, negotiate remote/part-time using your leverage  
3. **Double down on BuilderHaus:** Create content specifically for members  
4. **Scale service:** Hire VA for admin work, focus only on delivery  
5. **Plan Season 2:** "Building With Paid Tools" (30 more days, showing the difference)

**Business Strategy:**

* Focus on recurring revenue growth (BuilderHaus 100 → 500 members)  
* Productize service (create packages: Starter, Growth, Scale)  
* Launch affiliate program (members refer, earn 20%)

---

## **Scenario B: Hit Partial Goals ($5K-$10K)**

**What This Means:**

* You've validated the model but not at scale  
* Need more time to reach full-time income  
* Mix of one-time and recurring revenue

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Negotiate at job:** Ask for remote work or flexible hours using your side revenue as proof  
2. **Continue BuilderHaus:** Keep it small but active (50-100 members)  
3. **Focus on MRR growth:** Community is more valuable than one-time service  
4. **Launch smaller series:** "10 SaaS Ideas in 10 Weeks" (weekly, not daily)

**Business Strategy:**

* Get BuilderHaus to 200 members ($8K-$10K MRR) \= full-time viable  
* Reduce service work (too time-intensive)  
* Create more digital products (higher margin, passive)

---

## **Scenario C: Didn't Hit Goals (\<$5K)**

**What This Means:**

* The model needs adjustment  
* Positioning or execution had issues  
* Portfolio is valuable even without revenue

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Leverage portfolio for job search:** 30 builds \= incredible resume  
2. **Keep BuilderHaus small:** 30-50 members ($1,500-$2,500/mo side income)  
3. **Analyze what went wrong:** Was it pricing? Positioning? Audience fit?  
4. **Continue service work:** 1-2 clients/month while job searching ($1K-$2K/mo)  
5. **Create honest debrief:** "What I Learned Building 30 Apps" (this content will perform)

**Business Strategy:**

* Use 30 apps as portfolio for PM/dev jobs  
* Position as "I can ship fast" in interviews  
* Keep products live but don't stress revenue  
* BuilderHaus becomes side project/community

---

## **Scenario D: Got Dream Job Offer**

**What This Means:**

* Someone saw your work and wants to hire you  
* Salary likely $80K-$150K (PM/dev roles)  
* You've proven execution ability

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Negotiate:** Use your side revenue as leverage for salary/equity  
2. **Take the job:** Stable income \+ proven builder \= best position  
3. **Keep BuilderHaus:** Side project for community \+ extra income  
4. **Maintain products passively:** Digital products \= passive income  
5. **Use in new role:** 30-day challenge becomes case study

**Business Strategy:**

* BuilderHaus \= weekend project (manageable at 50-100 members)  
* No new service work (focus on day job)  
* Keep digital products live (passive income)  
* Build at new company (you're now "the person who ships")

---

## **Scenario E: VC/Angel Wants to Invest**

**What This Means:**

* Someone believes in you enough to invest  
* Likely $50K-$200K pre-seed check  
* You need to decide: bootstrap or raise?

**Immediate Questions to Ask:**

1. What are they investing in? (You? The platform? A specific app?)  
2. What's the valuation? (Don't give away \>20% this early)  
3. What's their involvement? (Hands-off or active?)  
4. What are the terms? (SAFE, equity, convertible note?)

**Decision Framework:**

**Take the money if:**

* You have a specific app from the 30 that has traction  
* You need capital to scale (hiring, tools, marketing)  
* The investor brings strategic value (intros, expertise)  
* Terms are founder-friendly (\<20% dilution)

**Don't take the money if:**

* You're already profitable from community \+ service  
* You don't have clear use of funds  
* Terms are predatory (\>25% for \<$100K)  
* You'd lose control of direction

**Best Move:**

* Finish BuilderHaus launch first  
* Get to $10K MRR from own revenue  
* THEN raise if you want to scale faster  
* Raising from profit position \= better terms

# **FINAL WORD: THE REAL SUCCESS METRIC**

## **The Only Metric That Actually Matters**

**Did you ship all 30 days?**

Everything else—views, revenue, VC attention, job offers—is secondary.

The primary success is: **Did you do what you said you'd do?**

30 days. 30 apps. No excuses.

Because here's what most people don't understand:

* **Views don't matter** if you didn't finish  
* **Revenue doesn't matter** if you quit at Day 20  
* **VC interest doesn't matter** if you can't prove consistency

The real product isn't the apps.

**The real product is YOU proving you can execute under constraint.**

That's what employers hire.  
That's what investors fund.  
That's what customers trust.

So when Day 30 comes, and someone asks "Was it worth it?"

The answer isn't the money.  
The answer isn't the followers.  
The answer isn't the opportunities.

The answer is: **"I said I would. And I did."**

That's the game.
