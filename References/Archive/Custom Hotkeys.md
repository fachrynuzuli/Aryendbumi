# Custom Hotkeys

### Quick Switcher

It is a good habit to use the quick switcher (ctrl+o) when making a new note. Start typing the title of the note and if there is an existing one that is similar, you can use that note. If its a completely new note, type the title anyway and press enter.

I use this feature so often I have it set on mobile as the quick action to toggle. (simply use a quick swipe down motion on your screen). You can do this in the mobile settings. 

I found this to be the fastest and most frictionless way to make new notes. 

See [[Obsidian Commands]] for an extended list of commands that dynamically updates as you change them.
