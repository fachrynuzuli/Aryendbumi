## PART 1: 30-DAY LAUNCH SEQUENCE

### Week 1: Foundation & First Social Proof (Days 1-7)

**Goal:** Post LinkedIn launch content, collect first 50+ email leads, establish "The Kamal Way" as your branded framework

#### Day 1: IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (Within 2 Hours)

**PRIORITY ACTION: Post LinkedIn Launch Content**

```
Kemarin gue ngajar workshop 'Design Your Dream Career' ke high school students.

They called me 'authority.'
They said I'm 'successful person.'

Honestly? Gue nggak expect that.

But I realized something:

The framework I taught them—The Kamal Way—is exactly what transformed MY career from frustrated corporate guy to someone who gets invited to teach career workshops.

K - Know Yourself (bukan ikutin kompas orang lain)
A - Acquire Skills (every problem is skill problem)
M - Make it Your Passion (don't follow, create it)
A - Adjust Perspective (career bukan tangga, bisa sideway)
L - Lifelong Project (work and life adalah satu kesatuan)

Gue combine framework ini dengan AI-native skills (LLM mastery, prompt engineering, context management).

Result?
✅ Career pivot dalam 6 bulan
✅ Leading multimillion dollar projects
✅ Building authority di AI + career strategy

Sekarang gue mau share framework ini ke Indonesian professionals yang feel stuck.

Buat lo yang curious atau butuh this transformation:

Drop 🔥 di comment, gue DM lo dengan The Kamal Way Career + AI Audit (free).

Lo akan tau exactly where you're stuck—and how to break through.

Let's build AI-native Indonesia together. 🇮🇩
