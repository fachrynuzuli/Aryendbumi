# you've come a long way 
*05 Sep, 2024* 

You've come a long way. Don't take everything for granted.

No matter how mad you are at your current state
No matter how sad you are at your current situations
No matter how hard you've tried but you always fall short

Keep in mind, that there were a younger version of you who are proud of what you've been right now.

In life, progress is rarely linear. It's filled with obstacles, moments of doubt, and setbacks that test your resilience. However, those are necessity — catalysts that'll push you forward. Forcing you to adapt, learn, think, and grow.

You've come a long way. If you don't believe me, let's do this exercise:

	Take a piece of paper. write down everything you've done.
	Everything you've accomplished. Everything you improved. 

You'll be amazed at how much we forget about what we've done. Right?

Looking back at where you began, it’s easy to see how much has changed—not just in external achievements but in internal growth. You’ve learned new skills, gained experiences, and developed the mindset necessary to continue moving forward.

You just gotta enjoy the ride. You're going to be moving still, in upward trajectory. One year ago, you were on your knees praying to be where you are today. And sometimes you jsut got to take a step back and look at your wins and be like:

"Okay, yeah, I've come a long way."
