## How does this work?

Regardless of the app you are using, you really only need 3 folders to start with a zettelkasten. Main notes, index and source notes. No templates, advanced configurations, metadata or tags. It does not need to be any more complicated than this when starting out.

**Source Notes**
Make a new source note for each resource. Start with a bibliography on top, notes below it. Your notes are just quick observations of your source material. They may or may not link to main notes, but most of them won’t and that’s normal. Here is my video on writing source notes in an analog zk. It is the same process in Obsidian, you don’t really need a template for this.

**Main Notes**
These are what people often call “permanent notes” although I think the term is confusing. These are the main notes in your zk that contain single ideas that are filed with an alphanumeric ID. Your first note can be 1.1 for simplicity sake. I did a video on how to file and index in obsidian [here](https://youtu.be/_8dh0Ap7Jnc?si=T-vZ5NiQ4XIHAF6d).

**Index** 
Each index is based on a recurring keyterm you linked in your main notes. It’s as simple as a bulleted list of related links with their IDs. You don’t need to index every main note, just the ones at the top level of clusters or branches that navigate to that section of your zk.

That’s really it. Start out simple. Most people give up on zettelkasten because they overcomplicate it from the begging. What makes the zettelkasten is the filing system, so work on getting the hang of that and you’ll be on the right track.
