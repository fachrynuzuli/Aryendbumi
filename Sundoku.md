Seneca once said "The abundance of books is distraction."

**_sundoku_** is acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one’s home without reading them. The term originated in the Meiji era (1868–1912) as Japanese slang.

It is also used to refer to books ready for reading later when they are on a bookshelf. As currently written, the word combines the characters for “pile up” and the character for “read”.

In current ages, we know people who loves to save post rather than doing the necessary actions.
