Stop learning, start selling (8 months of selling AI automations)

What's up,

Just dropped a video tearing apart 8 months of selling AI automations.

The shift that made me actual money? Sell first, build later.

Everyone's preaching "spend 6 months mastering n8n before talking to clients" - that's fucking backwards. When you sell first, clients literally pay you to learn. Plus you're building skills they actually need, not theoretical bullshit that's obsolete by next Tuesday.

What actually matters:

Stop selling "automations" → sell amplifications. Nobody wants to fire their team. They want their $60K employee doing $200K worth of work.

Boring niches print stupid money. Private equity firms, law offices, accounting - repetitive processes everywhere, fat wallets, and zero competition because everyone's chasing sexy SaaS companies.

Specialists eat generalists for breakfast. Go deep on one niche instead of being mediocre at everything.

The game changed - delivery isn't the bottleneck anymore. You can build workflows in hours now. The constraint is getting clients to pay you for it.

Full breakdown's in this [video.](https://youtu.be/1poahYTVqjs?si=9hj8YDeqBpRF1ql0 "https://youtu.be/1poahYTVqjs?si=9hj8YDeqBpRF1ql0")

If you're still "learning before selling" - you're actively losing money while telling yourself you're being smart
