# shorts - ai maximalist
*08 Jul, 2025*

**Video Title Idea:** You're Using AI Wrong.

**Visual Style:** Same as before. Raw, selfie-style, close-up, direct eye contact.

**(The Script/Prompt)**

**(0:00 - 0:05) The Hook**
*(Look directly into the camera, calm but intense.)*
"This is for anyone who's been playing with ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude.
I think you're using it to make yourself comfortable. And it's a huge mistake."

**(0:06 - 0:35) The Contrarian Message & Pain Point**
"You ask it for 10 ideas. You ask it to summarize an article you're too lazy to read. You ask it to write an email for you.
You're using it as a shortcut. A glorified Google. An intern that never sleeps.
And every time you do that, the muscle in your brain that's supposed to do the hard work... gets a little bit weaker.
You're not amplifying your intelligence. You're outsourcing it.
That's not being an AI Maximalist. That's being an AI Minimalist. You're playing on easy mode."

**(0:36 - 1:05) The New Paradigm**
"The real power of AI isn't in getting answers. It's in the quality of the *disagreement*.
It's a sparring partner. A tireless debater. A tool to stress-test your own beliefs and make your own arguments stronger.
You think you're smart? Try winning an argument against a machine that has access to all of human knowledge and can formulate a counter-argument in half a second.
That's where the real growth is. In the friction. In the conflict."

**(1:06 - 1:18) THE PAUSE**
*(Hold a direct, challenging stare. Complete silence for 10-12 seconds. Let the idea of "arguing with a machine" sink in. Let them feel the challenge.)*

**(1:19 - 1:45) The Actionable AI Task**
"So here's your action. Right now.
Open your favorite AI chatbot. I want you to pick one strong belief you hold.
*'University is the only path to success.'*
*'AI will destroy creativity.'*
*'I'm not good enough to start a business.'*

And I want you to type in this exact prompt."

*(Optional: Show the prompt on screen as you say it.)*

**"Your role is now a 'Devil's Advocate'. Your sole mission is to ruthlessly dismantle the following belief I hold. Use logic, evidence, and first-principles thinking. Do not be agreeable. Challenge my every assumption. My belief is: [insert your belief here]."**

**(1:46 - End) The Final Punch**
"Stop using AI for easy answers. Start using it for hard questions.
That's the action.
Go do it."

*(End with a final, firm, knowing look. Cut.)*
