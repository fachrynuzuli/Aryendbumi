# Without Conflict Theres No Change

[Original date: 02 Sep, 2024]

The level of conflict you're willing to endure will be the level of change you inflict. Inadvertently when we introduce change, not everyone is going to be thrilled. 

In times of turmoil, embracing change is not an option but a necessity for growth. Consensus often fails, but for greater good— *if you please everyone, you please no one*.

As a leader, you want to have a healthy level of conflict in your organization. Harmony is great, but the long term impact of high agreeableness will withstand any potentially good idea rises to the top.
