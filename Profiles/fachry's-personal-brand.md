### Content Strategy Framework

To build authority and connect with your audience, consistency and relevance are key.

**Content Pillars:** Your three areas of mastery provide natural content pillars:

1. **AI for Work:** Practical tips, tool reviews, workflow breakdowns, news, and case studies on leveraging AI for business tasks and efficiency.
1. **People & Influence:** Insights, strategies, and personal anecdotes on communication, leadership, change management, negotiation, and building professional relationships.
1. **Business Mastery:** Concepts of system thinking, process analysis, fundamental business logic, document creation strategies, and understanding the corporate environment.

You can structure your content around these three pillars, ensuring you cover a range of topics relevant to your audience.

**Content Calendar Outline:**

  - **Weekly Focus:** Dedicate each week (or alternating weeks) to one of your content pillars. This helps structure your topics and ensures variety.
  - **Daily/Frequent Content:** Create smaller, more frequent content pieces (e.g., tweets, Instagram stories, short LinkedIn posts) directly addressing a single audience pain point from your lists.
  - **Weekly/Bi-weekly Deep Dive:** Produce one more substantial piece of content (e.g., a long-form article, YouTube video, podcast episode) that explores a topic from your foundational content list in more depth.
  - **Repurposing Day:** Set aside time each week to repurpose content created earlier in the week or month into different formats.

**Platform Strategy:** You have existing presences across several key platforms. Leverage them strategically:

  - **_Primary Platforms:_**

    - **LinkedIn:** Ideal for sharing long-form articles (using the platform's article feature), detailed posts on project management, digital transformation, AI in professional settings, and leadership insights. Connect with professionals in your target audience.

    - **Twitter (X):** Excellent for sharing quick tips ("AI prompt of the day," "1 leadership lesson"), short takes on news, engaging in conversations, and sharing links to your longer content.

    - **YouTube:** Best for demonstrating AI tools in action, explaining complex concepts (like system thinking or change models) visually, sharing personal stories, or delivering mini-lessons on influence. Video is powerful for building connection and demonstrating expertise.
  - **_Secondary Platform:_**

    - **Instagram:** Use this to build a more personal connection. Share behind-the-scenes glimpses of your work/learning, infographic summaries of your key concepts, quotes related to influence or productivity, and short video "reels" offering quick hacks or insights. Drive traffic to your other platforms or website.
  - **_Content Hub:_** Fachrynuzuli.com / Fachry.substack.com: Your website/Substack serves as the central hub for your most valuable long-form content. Drive traffic from social media to these platforms to build your email list and deepen engagement.

**Content Repurposing Method:**

  - **Long-form Article (Substack/Website):**

    - Break into shorter posts for LinkedIn or Twitter threads.

    - Extract key quotes for Instagram visuals or tweets.

    - Turn sections into mini-lessons for Instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts.

    - Use the core ideas as the basis for a YouTube video script.
  - **YouTube Video:**

    - Transcribe the audio for a blog post or Substack article.

    - Extract short clips for Twitter, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts.

    - Create audio-only versions for a potential podcast.

    - Summarize key points for LinkedIn or Twitter posts.
  - **Podcast Episode:**

    - Transcribe the audio for an article or blog post.

    - Pull short audio clips or quotes with waveforms for social media sharing.

    - Turn key discussion points into script ideas for videos or social threads.
  - **Social Media Posts (Threads, Carousels):**

    - Combine related posts into a longer blog article or section of an e-book.

    - Use as inspiration for video content or deeper dives.

By consistently creating content across these pillars and strategically repurposing it, you'll build a strong personal brand that attracts your target audience and positions you as an authority at the powerful intersection of human skills and technological leverage.
