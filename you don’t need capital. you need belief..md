# you don’t need capital. you need belief.
*29 Jun, 2025* 

for the last whatever amount of years, the game was: tell a story, raise money, build something, then try to get people to care.

but in the modern era that game is collapsing. the ladder seems to be missing rungs. the gatekeepers are bored. & capital isn’t scarce anymore… trust is.

signull vs. noise is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

the new game is to aggregate belief before you aggregate capital.

build attention before you build anything else.

become undeniable before you even start.

**the old playbook:**

if you want to be a vc, get into a top firm.

or raise a fund.

if you want to be a founder, launch a startup.

or write a whitepaper.

or send some cold emails.

then hope people believe you’re legit after.

**here’s the new one:**

write something that hits.

build an audience that cares.

prove you understand the moment.

then capital calls you.

attention has become the new underwriting. if people trust your taste, your voice, your gut, you’re default credible. the capital follows because it has to. you’ve built the funnel in reverse: belief first, money second.

this is not necessarily about clout chasing. it’s about narrative control.

when you aggregate attention first, you own the story. you don’t have to ask permission. you don’t have to wait for intros. you don’t have to beg for a seat at the table. you become the table.

this is how creators become allocators.

how meme lords become market movers.

how founders raise on vibes, because the vibes are real.

money is downstream of trust.

trust is downstream of attention.

& attention is yours to earn.
