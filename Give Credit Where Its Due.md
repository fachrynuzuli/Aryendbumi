# Give Credit Where Its Due

[Original date: 06 Sep, 2024]

For every successful event I've ever experienced in my careerhood, one quote has been the lifeblood of my career: **"Credit where the credit is due."**

Recognizing other's efforts can incrementally increases our chance of success. 

**Recognizing others build trust among team members.** When you acknowledge other's hard work publicly, it's a sign that you know and value their contributions.

**Recognition encourages collaboration.** Collaboration thrives in an environment of mutual respect.

**Giving credit help builds positive work environment.** A simple act of appreciation towards colleague for their work can make a significant difference.

Work is a place where you learn how to teach others without teaching.
