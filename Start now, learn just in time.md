#### start now, learn just in time
*03 Sep, 2024* 

The greatest skill one can develop is decreasing the time between idea and execution.

When you have idea, best step you can take — *as someone truly believe in you* — is executing the idea ASAP. For every minutes you delay the action, fats will slowly build around your idea inside your head. Sit tight, collecting dust, waiting for the perfect time to be used (if somehow recalled).

Me too not escaping the same thing. Chaos ensued due to failure in keeping order equilibrium for any new inflow of ideas, and minimal outflow that occurs at the same time. One of the few example is me failing to build "Zettelkasten" in Obsidian that turns to messy jumble due to hoarding so many notes, concept, ideas, talking points, ideas (call it twice) just in case.

Just in case is the archenemy of just in time. Just in case meaning you would love to keep the information in front of you because maybe someday you would need that. Just in time, on the other hand, is learning skills/knowledges only when you need the it. Just in time is the correct way to approach ideas collecting in minimalistic manner.

Just in case focusing on hoarding skills, knowledges, ideas, information. While just in time centered around action, result, feedback, and iteration, rather than just stockpiling huge reserves of materials (your skills) just before you start.

Most of us skewed towards having a comprehensive map for all locations and check points where we would like to go. WRONG. Just pick something that you can stop learning just in case and start learning just in time. Too many people waiting to get started reading a bunch of business books, or reading a bunch of writing books before they even get started on that.

Just start, learn everything, just in time.
