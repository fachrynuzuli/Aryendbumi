- Miskonsepsi Niche: Kita bukannya ga boleh punya bahasan detail. Go niche with content, but not with your identity. Kalau kamu jago main basket, bukan berarti kamu bodoh main sepakbola. Bisa jadi kamu bisa gunain kemampuan lompat kamu (dari basket) untuk menjadi striker header yang hebat di sepakbola.
- Don’t be so attached to who you are in the present, you don’t give the future version of you a chance. 
- Saat ini aku lv 4 (karyawan), tujuanku lv10 (businessman). Aku harus kerja utk ngumpul skil biar bs maik level. Aku akan kesulitan jika lgsg main di lv 8, aku akan perform di lv 3 atau 4, menyulitkan

- Purpose is a goal. Most people don't choose their own goals. A goal implies knowledge and skills that must be learned to solve problems that prevent you from achieving the goal.
- shallow purpose: dulu (2019) aku pernah jawab pertanyaan salah satu teman dekat, bagaimana future mu? Aku menjawab dengan super keren dan terstruktur, speerti "beli mini cooper" di usia 30. Gapapa. Intinya adalah, kita mulai dari tujuan yg shallow, dangkal. Dalam prosesnya kita akan menemukan tujuan yg lbh berarti
- Do you HAVE to become an entrepreneur to get paid for what you enjoy doing? No. Do you HAVE to become and entrepreneur? Well, maybe

1. prioritize distribution: an amazing product or idea without effective distribution is worthless. 
2. leverage ai for speed: use ai to drastically reduce the time needed for tasks like coding, writing, and research, enabling rapid prototyping and iteration. 
3. context is king for ai: generic ai prompts yield generic results... feed ai specific context about yourself, your business, and your goals for high-leverage outputs. 
4. build ecosystems, not just products: think beyond single offers... create interconnected systems (tools, communities, content) that feed each other. 
5. master prompt engineering: learn to communicate clearly and specifically with ai, using domain language and structured prompts to control output quality. 
6. embrace iteration & mvps: launch quickly with a minimum viable product and improve based on feedback, rather than getting stuck striving for perfection pre-launch. 
7. data quality over quantity: when training or feeding ai, focus on high-quality, relevant data rather than just massive, unfiltered datasets. 
8. tool-chaining solves complex problems: combine multiple specialized ai tools or models in sequence to tackle challenges that a single tool cannot. 
9. identify and serve a niche: finding a specific audience with strong desires or fears (like the "apocalypse niche") creates powerful opportunities. 
10. automate repetitive tasks: use ai and automation tools to handle tasks like content repurposing, lead qualification, or even basic customer service. 
11. learn by building: the fastest way to understand ai capabilities and limitations is by actively building tools and projects, even simple ones. 
12. authenticity builds trust: develop a unique brand voice and be transparent... audiences resonate with authenticity over generic corporate speak. 
13. repurpose everything: maximize content value by repurposing successful pieces of content across different platforms. 
14. community increases value: integrating products/services within a community fosters loyalty and significantly increases value compared to standalone saas. 
15. understand ai economics: be aware of api costs and token limits... strive to understand token economics. 
16. solve your own problems first: creating tools or systems to solve your own inefficiencies often leads to valuable products for others. 
17. leverage existing platforms: utilize platforms like poe, hugging face, or github, for hosting models, or finding pre-built components. 
18. monetize multiple layers: combine free lead magnets, low-ticket offers, core subscriptions, high-ticket services, and affiliate plays within your ecosystem. 
19. positioning is crucial: how you frame your offer and yourself in the market is as important as the product itself. 
20. focus breeds execution: while idea generation is valuable, avoid getting paralyzed by too many options focus on executing one high-potential project at a time. 
21. use ai for research & ideation: leverage llms to analyze markets, competitors, conversations (like your own chats), and brainstorm new angles or features. 
22. interactive learning is powerful: move beyond passive content consumption create interactive learning experiences (like ai tutors or simulations) for better engagement and retention. 
23. delegate or outsource non-core tasks: once profitable, hire specialists (devs, designers, editors) to handle tasks outside your core strengths. 
24. build in public: sharing progress, insights, and even struggles builds audience trust. 
25. capture leads aggressively: use lead magnets (free tools, guides, prompts) constantly to build your email list or telegram channel. 
26. seek high-leverage partnerships: collaborate with individuals whenever there is a shared mutual benefit, this offers significant distribution or resource advantages. 
27. fail fast and adapt: not every idea or tool will be a hit... the key is to test quickly, gather feedback, and pivot or discard without excessive attachment. 
28. structure your knowledge: use project management tools (notion or custom apps) to organize ideas, plans, and resources systematically, especially when collaborating. 
29. create feedback loops: actively solicit and analyze user feedback to guide product development and iteration. 
30. think in frameworks & first principles: break down complex problems or goals into their fundamental components to identify the most efficient solutions (ai can assist with this).
